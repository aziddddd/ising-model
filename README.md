# Ising-model
- Simulation of 2 Dimensional Ising model by Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics.
- This simulation can be run with Jupyter notebook integrated with docker-compose.
- Run with docker-compose for quick overview. 
- Enable the mingw32 compiler if the cythonized code is run on jupyter locally (Check the cythonize code). This is faster than that when running using docker-compose.
- Further detail can be obtained here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model
